# Title

<b> How do diets compare ? </b>

While our first approach was mainly focused on a store comparision, we refocused our work on more complete features of products from the Open Food Fact database. After further analysis of the database following Milestone 1, we decided to exploit food categories, packaging, and nutrition to make a comparision between modern eating habits.

# Abstract

Wether it be for medical purposes or ethical beliefs, most humans are confronted to diet restrictions at some points in their lives. From an ethical standpoint, animal abuse and ecological principles can lead to the choice of Veganism, and provide a narrower product choice in grocery shopping. Obesity can be fought by avoiding sugar rich products. Guten-free or lactose-free diets are sometimes necessary after discovering an intolerance. However, making the sacrifice isn't so easy. But, how do diet choices affect ourselves and our surroundings? More accurately, what are the environmental and nutritional impacts of diets ?

With our work, we want to provide a better understanding of the effects in choosing certain diet types, based on how nutritious and eco-friendly they are.

# Research questions

- Which diet provides the best products in terms of nutrition ?
To answer this question, we need a good filtering method to keep or drop certain products per diet. We also need a strong nutrition ranking method for each food category.

- Are standard nutrition rankings reliable, and if not how to create a trustworthy one ? 
Evoked during Milestone 1 preparation, this question is tackled by computing the nutrition score for a majority of products, and comparing it to already available nutrition grades.
 

- Do certain diets favorize certain packaging methods ? How does each diet participate in recycling?

# Work before Report/Milestone 3

- Create Website for story visualization
- Collect results for each diet and create informative visualizations
- Explain approach to our nutrition ranking and compare it to the one available in the database
- If correlation is visible, expand story to prediction of diet preferences per Swiss canton according to evolution of quantity and proportions of recycled waste (plastic, metal, paper, glass,...)



# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- <b>3.11.2019</b> Explore the need and way to enrich the database for more stores, categories, nutrition, and carbon footprint fields.
- <b>10.11.2019</b> Add found information to database products, clean overall dataset, retain relevant information and products.
- <b>17.11.2019</b> Perform analysis for each criteria and create a store ranking for each
- <b>24.11.2019</b> Present the results with convincing and appropriate visualizations

# Questions for TA
- Only 17% of the products have a store assigned which reduces the dataset to 180167 products. We haven't found a way yet to find the stores of products with missing. Do you think the amount of data is sufficient for reasonable conclusions ?

- About 500 products already have carbon footprints. Do you think we should recalculate the carbon footprint for them since calculations won't take the same parameters into consideration ?
