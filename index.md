Are you Vegan ? Is this dish gluten-free ? These are the types of questions that made us all come to realize that what you eat has become a standardized normality. The no-meat, no-dairy, no-gluten regimes have become household names for either the medical need or the trendy conviction. In 2016, 0.8% of the french population was assumed to be intolerant to gluten, yet 7% regularly buy gluten-free products.* . This is an example of how food diets do not only emerge from individual medical conditions but also, and mainly, from collective trends through advertisement, accessibility, and media coverage.

Along with a modern rise of social and cultural movements, the adoption of new eating habits and debates around different food diets are topics to stay. So how does production react to new consumption tendencies ?
