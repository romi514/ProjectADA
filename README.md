# Title

<b> How do diets compare ? </b>

While our first approach was mainly focused storewise, we reconsidered the objective of our work on more reliable subsets of the Open Food Fact database. Indeed, most of the work that we did already was more about the product itself rather than the selling company. We only had a gross idea of what was possible with this database at Milestone 1 and after further research we had to clean, enrich and correct a major part of selected fields.

Ultimatly, we now are interested in studying certain diet types and how nutritious and eco-friendly they are based on several criteria.


# Abstract

Diets restrictions can be encountered at a certain point in any customer's life. From an ethical side, animal abuse and ecological principles can lead to the choice of Veganism, and provide a narrower grocery list avoiding animal based food. 
Obesity can be fought by avoiding sugar rich products. Lactose-free products are sometimes necessary after discovering an intolerance.
In a few exemples, we understand that the main reason to choose another diet type emerges from either medical reasons, to avoid allergies and intolerances or social and ethical aspects. Yet making the sacrifice isn't so easy.

With our work, we want to provide a better understanding of what lies behind the choice of a certain diet type, not only propose high standard products, based on how nutricious and eco-friendly they are, but also deeply understand how such sacrifice is worth.

# Research questions

- Which diet provides the best products in terms of nutrition ?
To answer this question, we need a good filtering method to keep or drop certain products per diet. We also need a strong nutricious ranking method per food category since we want to offer a wide variety of products and avoid final suggestions to buy only glass water bottles.

- Are standard nutrition rankings reliable, and if not how to create a trustworthy one ? 
Evoked during Milestone 1 preparation, this question was wrapped up by first enriching the nutriscore available in the database. We only had access to a score ranging from -15 up to 40 that didn't differentiate food category and was rather unreliable. We therefore computed a new nutrition score, based on several criteria :
TO COMPLETE (MAT)

- How to construct a diet based on products choosen by consumers ?
One of the most important side of this project is to provide a reliable list of products per diet and classify as much products as possible.
It recquires a strong filtering analysis of words that descibe the product but also the ingredients to enrich as much as possible each diet category and avoid missleading suggestions. Moreover, we need to decide which criteria must be considered and to what extend. 

- Would it be possible to suggest products which packaging is the most eco-friendly ?
While the completness of this field is only up to 20% in the database, it can still provide a good idea of how each food category is stored and protected before consumption. We want to understand the ecological impact of each wrapping method and provide products that respect an eco-friendly life span.

-Statistical strenght of suggestions
It is rather wiseful to track every loss of informations when trying to reduce the complexity and dimentionality of a database. We need to make sure that the statistical accuracy of our work is reliable, and respect the incompletness of our database. Enriching a subset can be sometimes reliable and easy with numbers but when it comes to words, the work becomes twice as hard if not more. We need to supervise our filtering method to ensure that it keeps important words, clean the unworthy elements and be reliable.

# What next ?



**** 


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- <b>3.11.2019</b> Explore the need and way to enrich the database for more stores, categories, nutrition, and carbon footprint fields.
- <b>10.11.2019</b> Add found information to database products, clean overall dataset, retain relevant information and products.
- <b>17.11.2019</b> Perform analysis for each criteria and create a store ranking for each
- <b>24.11.2019</b> Present the results with convincing and appropriate visualizations

# Questions for TA
- Only 17% of the products have a store assigned which reduces the dataset to 180167 products. We haven't found a way yet to find the stores of products with missing. Do you think the amount of data is sufficient for reasonable conclusions ?

- About 500 products already have carbon footprints. Do you think we should recalculate the carbon footprint for them since calculations won't take the same parameters into consideration ?

# New Objective

The study focuses on four main steps:

- Product categorization
- Packaging methods
- Nutrition Scores
- Diet Comparision

While this question recquires a deeper research in Companies field, we will manage our way towards it by first creating adapted diets based on our calculated nutriscores, packaging types and will rank Companies by the wide choice they can offer to customers following certain diet types. We will try to rank companies under strict criteria
