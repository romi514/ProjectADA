# Title

Title ideas for database InstaCart:

1. How to set up an optimal supermarket, as to optimize customer walking time through the aisles. We can either do a simple store architecture or propose to each customer a path to follow in the supermarket with sometimes deviations to find new product. We can compute paths such that customers don't overpopulate one section...

2. Evaluate which products are addictive, which products lead to buying other ones...

3. Along with Open Food Facts Database, find the typical weekly nutrition of a consummer. Analyse it, cluster it to find different eating habits? Propose a weekly diet ? 

4. Along with Open Food Facts Database, find out what the optimal product in terms of financial benefits for the company selling it and nutritive benefits would like. (find the closest product to it and/or create one?)
